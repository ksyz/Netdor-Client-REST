=head1 NAME

Netdot::Client::REST - Perl module for interacting with the Netdot application using the REST model

=head1 SYNOPSIS

use Netdot::Client::REST;
my $netdot = Netdot::Client::REST->new(
    server=>'http://localhost.localdomain/netdot',
    username=>'admin',
    password=>'xxxxx',
    );

# Get all devices
my $dev = $netdot->get('/Device');

# Get Device id 1
my $dev = $netdot->get('/Device/1');

# Get Device id 1 and foreign objects one level away
my $dev = $netdot->get('/Device/1?depth=1');

# Update Device 1
$dev = $netdot->post('/Device/1', {community=>'public'});

# Delete Device 1
$netdot->delete('/Device/1');

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Netdot::Client::REST can be used in Perl scripts that need access to the Netdot application
database. Communication occurs over HTTP/HTTPS, thus avoiding the need to open SQL access on the
machine running Netdot.

=head2 new - Constructor and login method

  Arguments:
    server    - Netdot installation URL (e.g. http://host.localdomain/netdot)

=head1 INSTANCE METHODS

############################################################################
=head2 get - Get all attributes from one or more Netdot objects

  Arguments:
    Resource  - string containing RESTful resource

    In addition to the object's class and (optional) ID, the HTTP argument "depth"
    allows the user to fetch all foreign objects recursively, limited by the
    value of the depth argument.  Foreign objects include relational records 
    referenced by the given object and records that reference the given object (both
    sides of the one-to-many relationship).  The performance impact of the given depth
    is a balance between fewer queries with large datasets and more queries with smaller
    datasets. The default depth is 0 (only return the given object).

  Returns:
    hashref with object's attributes
    
    A special attribute is added for each foreign key that allows the programmer
    to request that resource more easily.  For example, if a record has a field
    called 'foo' which is a foreign key pointing to a record of class 'Bar', 
    with id '1', then the result hashref will include a keys like:

       foo => 'Foo bar name',
       foo_xlink => 'Bar/1',

    where 'foo_xlink' can be passed to this method to get the full Bar/1 resource.

  Examples:
    my $dev = $netdot->get('Device/1');
    my $dev = $netdot->get('Device/1?depth=1');
    my @alldevs = $netdot->get('Device');
    my @mydevs = $netdot->get('Device?sysname=mydev');

=head2 post - Update or Insert a Netdot object

  Arguments:
    Resource  - string containing RESTful resource
    data      - Hashref containing key/value pairs
  Returns:
    hashref with object's attributes
  Examples:
    $netdot->post('Device/1', %data);
    $netdot->post('Device', %data);

############################################################################
=head2 delete - Delete a Netdot object

  Arguments:
    Resource  - string containing RESTful resource
  Returns:
    True if successful
  Examples:
    $netdot->delete('Device/1');
